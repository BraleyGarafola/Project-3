        <p class="BG-featured-item-description">For this project we were asked to compose a self portrait of ourselves. We were able to choose whichever photo we wanted as long as the full face was in it. I chose a photo that had a good bit of detail and different colors so I could challenge myself since I have never worked with Illustrator prior to this project. The background color was chosen because it is nice and plain, but also because it a warmer tone to my favorite color. </p>
